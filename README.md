# nyc-taxi-fare-prediction-shiny-app
This project is an interactive Shiny app developed in R, designed to predict taxi fares in New York City using machine learning. Leveraging historical NYC taxi trip data, the app integrates a Random Forest model to predict fare amounts based on key features such as trip distance, passenger count, and pickup time. The app’s interface is divided into two main sections: a sidebar for data upload and control settings, and a main panel displaying fare prediction outputs and model metrics. Users can upload a CSV file containing relevant trip data, which is then preprocessed to convert date columns, create time-based features like pickup hour and day of the week, and filter trips to ensure they fall within NYC’s boundaries.

The feature engineering stage enhances model accuracy by adding variables that capture fare variations across different times, such as rush hour or off-peak hours. The Random Forest model is trained on these features, as it effectively handles complex patterns in data, enabling robust fare predictions. Once predictions are generated, users can view the fare distribution through a histogram, showing the range of predicted fares, from short local rides to longer journeys. Additionally, R-squared serves as a primary evaluation metric, indicating how well the model explains fare variability.

Beyond fare prediction, the app offers data visualizations to analyze NYC taxi demand and trip patterns. An interactive map built with the leaflet package shows high-demand pickup locations across the city. Using DBSCAN clustering, the app also identifies concentrated areas like airports and business districts, displayed on scatter plots to reveal key demand zones. The density plots and time-based trip counts further illustrate busy periods, helping users understand NYC’s taxi demand trends.

Throughout development, the project faced challenges, including handling the large dataset efficiently, integrating complex visualizations, and balancing model accuracy with app responsiveness. By optimizing sample sizes and model settings, the app achieves both performance and reliability. This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning and geographic insights in fare prediction, making it a valuable tool for analyzing taxi patterns in NYC.
